    /**
     * @brief A class that encapsulates a vector.
     * This is a vector in the mathematical sense and not in the sense of an
     * array or STL container.
     * This class handles both serial and distributed
     * vector in a unfied way. There are different constructors provided for the
     * serial and distributed case.
     *
     * The serial Vector, as the name suggests, resides entirely in a processor.
     *
     * The distributed Vector, on the other hand, is distributed across a set of
     * processors. The storage of the distributed Vector in a processor
     * comprises of two parts:
     *   1. <b>locally owned part</b>: A part of the distribute dVector, defined
     * through a contiguous range of indices \f$[a,b)\f$ (\f$a\f$ is included,
     * but \f$b\f$ is not), for which the current processor is the sole owner.
     *      The size of the locally owned part (i.e., \f$b-a\f$) is termed as \e
     * locallyOwnedSize.
     *   2. <b>ghost part</b>: Part of the distributed Vector, defined through a
     * set of ghost indices, that are owned by other processors. The size of
     * ghost part is termed as \e ghostSize.
     *
     * Both the <b>locally owned part</b> and the <b>ghost part</b> are stored
     * in a contiguous memory inside a MemoryStorage object, with the <b>locally
     * owned part</b> stored first. The global size of the distributed Vector
     * (i.e., the number of unique indices across all the processors) is simply
     * termed as \e size. Additionally, we define \e localSize = \e
     * locallyOwnedSize + \e ghostSize.
     *
     * We handle the serial Vector as a special case of the distributed Vector,
     * wherein \e size = \e locallyOwnedSize and \e ghostSize = 0.
     *
     * @note While typically one would link to an MPI library while compiling this class,
     * care is taken to seamlessly allow usage of this class even while not
     * linking to an MPI library. To do so, we have our own MPI wrappers that
     * defaults to the MPI library's function calls and definitions while
     * linking to an MPI library and provides a serial equivalent of those
     * functions while not linking to an MPI library. This allows the user of
     * this class to seamlessly switch between linking and de-linking to an MPI
     * library without any change in the code and with the expected behavior.
     *
     * @note Note that the case of not linking to an MPI library and the case of
     * creating a serial mult-Vector are two independent things. One can still
     * create a serial Vector while linking to an MPI library and
     * running the code across multipe processors. That is, one can create a
     * serial Vector in one or more than one of the set of processors used when
     * running in parallel. Internally, we handle this by using MPI_COMM_SELF
     * as our MPI_Comm for the serial Vector (i.e., the processor does self
     * communication). However, while not linking to an MPI library (which by
     * definition means running on a single processor), there is no notion of
     * communication (neither with self nor with other processors). In such
     * case, both serial and distributed mult-Vector mean the same thing and the
     * MPI wrappers ensure the expected behavior (i.e., the behavior of a Vector
     * while using just one processor)
     *
     * @note Broadly, there are two ways of constructing a distributed Vector.
     *  1. [<b>Prefered and efficient approach</b>] The first approach takes a
     *     pointer to an MPIPatternP2P as an input argument (along with other
     * arguments). The MPIPatternP2P, in turn, contains all the information
     *     regarding the locally owned and ghost part of the Vector as well as
     * the interaction map between processors. This is the most efficient way of
     *     constructing a distributed Vector as it allows for reusing of an
     *     already constructed MPIPatternP2P.
     *  2. [<b> Expensive approach</b>] The second approach takes in the
     *     locally owned, ghost indices or the total number of indices
     *     across all the processors and internally creates an
     *     MPIPatternP2P object. Given that the creation of an MPIPatternP2P is
     *     expensive, this route of constructing a distributed Vector
     *     <b>should</b> be avoided.
     *
     * @tparam template parameter ValueType defines underlying datatype being stored
     *  in the vector (i.e., int, double, complex<double>, etc.)

     * DEVICE) in which the vector must reside.
